# IPTables Firewall Project

After having used a DIY firewall I put together in around
2007, circumstances (COVID-19 social-distancing) have provided
an opportunity to rething my firewall.

This project will provide a much better environment for managing
my firewall.  If there is no other improvement, having the IPTables
rules under source control will increase the safety of experimenting
with different IPTables ideas.

I expect that the scripts will be BASH scripts, as it's the most
direct way to interact with the CLI interface of IPTables.

## Requirements

The firewall will also be a DHCP server.  I will include a link
to a page that seems helpful now, and I may add additional pages
if needed and they merit.
